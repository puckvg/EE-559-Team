# Project2 Documentation
Project2 is a minimal tensor library for deep learning using CPUs. The current version can:
- Build networks combining fully connected layers, Tanh and RELU
- Run forward and backward passes 
- Optimize parameters with SGD and Adam optimizers for MSE 

The deep learning functionality is in the `nn` module and the `trainer` can be used to facilitate training models.
